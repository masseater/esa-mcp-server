# Project Brief: esa.io MCP Server

## Core Goal

Create an MCP (My Custom Program) server that provides a command-line or API interface to interact with the esa.io API. This server will allow users to perform common esa.io operations programmatically.

## Key Features (Initial Scope)

- **User Info:** Retrieve authenticated user's information.
- **Posts:**
  - List posts (with search/filtering capabilities).
  - Get details of a specific post.
  - Create new posts.
  - Update existing posts.
  - Delete posts.

## Target Audience

Developers or users who want to automate interactions with their esa.io team space.

## Non-Goals (Initially)

- Complex UI/frontend.
- Support for all esa.io API endpoints (focus on core post and user operations first).
- Advanced features like webhooks, team management, etc. (can be added later).
